# piDIANA (Pathway Integration for the DIANA project)

This is an assignment from my bioinformatics class. This script integrates pathways
and diseases data into an existing neo4j database containing microRNA and Target
genes.

The BioParsingKegg.py module was made by my project partner.

The downloadSomeTarget.py module makes use of TargetDump2.json to set up a testing
neo4j database.
